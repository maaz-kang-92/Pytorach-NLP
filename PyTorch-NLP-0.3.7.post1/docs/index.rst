Welcome to Pytorch-NLP's documentation!
=======================================

PyTorch-NLP is a library for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python. It's built with the very
latest research in mind, and was designed from day one to support rapid prototyping. PyTorch-NLP
comes with pre-trained embeddings, samplers, dataset loaders, metrics, neural network modules
and text encoders. It's open-source software, released under the BSD3 license.
